What are Constructors: 
  Constructors are used to initialize the member of a class. They are invoked immediatly as soon as instance of the class is created. 
      1- A class can have more that one Constructors (Constructor Oberloading).
      2- A Construtor must have the same name as the class.
      
      class MyFirstClass{
        int x;
        // 0 argument constructor
        MyFirstClass(){
          x =10;
        }
        
        //1 argument consructor
        MyFirstClass(int z){
          x = 10*z;
        }
        
      }
      
      class MyOtherClass{
        static voic Main(string[] args){
          MyFirstClass obj = new MyFirstClass();   // This will call 0 arg constructor and x will be initialized with 10.
          MyFirstClass obj1 = new MyFirstClass(2); // This will call 1 arg constructor and x will be initialized with 20.
        }
      }

Types Of Constructors:
  1- Instance Constructors: 
            Constructors are of this type by default. This type of constructor triggers every time an instance of the class is 
            created and are used to initialize non-static members of the class.  
            
  2- Static Constructors: 
            Static constructors are used to initializing the static members of the class and implicitly called with the execution 
            of the class. you do not need to initialze a class to call them.
            R: Static Constructors can only be called once in the life cycle of a class execution.
